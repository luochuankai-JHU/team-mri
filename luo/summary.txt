Why has diffusion MRI become a principal modality for mapping connectomes in vivo? 
How do different image acquisition parameters, fiber tracking algorithms and other methodological choices affect connectome estimation? 
What are the main factors that dictate the success and failure of connectome reconstruction? 




Provide an overview of the key methods that can be used to estimate the nodes and edges of macroscale connectomes.

DMRI are still in their infancy.

Reviewed a number of studies that provide evidence of useful microstructural and network properties that can be extracted in various independent and biologically relevant contexts. 

Highlight some of the key deficiencies of current macroscale connectome mapping methodologies and motivate future developments.
