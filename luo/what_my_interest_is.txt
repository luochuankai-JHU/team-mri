I want to know and use some machine-learning/ deep-learning algorithm to deal with the data. 
I know it is a little different from the main goal of out team is, but I l love these guys and do not want to change a team.
I am fully convinced that there must be some points that we can combine these two ideas together(maybe add a new function to ndmg 
or improve the registration part of ndmg and so on)


So, I think that what I have to do are two things:
    1.run through the pipeline, totally understand the process of it, maybe find areas for improvements or the needs of new function.
    2.continue to study the machine-learning/ deep-learning algorithm. If we can find the joint point, we can use this methods to ndmg quickly
