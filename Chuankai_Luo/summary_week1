Provide an overview of the key methods that can be used to estimate the nodes and edges of macroscale connectomes.

DMRI are still in their infancy.

Reviewed a number of studies that provide evidence of useful microstructural and network properties that can be extracted in various independent and biologically relevant contexts. 

Highlight some of the key deficiencies of current macroscale connectome mapping methodologies and motivate future developments.
